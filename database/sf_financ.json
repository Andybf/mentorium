            "explanation": ", D, E     The following steps are required to disable Person Accounts and use the  Individual object model in Financial Services Cloud:  \u2022  Log a case with Salesforce to perform the conversion from Person Accounts  to the individual model. You need to contact Salesforce Support to request the  conver-sion from Person Accounts to the individual model. This is an irreversible  process that affects your data model and user interface. You should carefully  evaluate your business needs and test the functionality in a sandbox or developer  org before re-questing the conversion in production.  \u2022  Remove Person Account record types from the Individual Record Type  Mapper. You need to remove any Person Account record types that are mapped  to Individu-al record types in the Individual Record Type Mapper. This is a custom  setting that defines how records are created when using certain features, such as  Einstein Da-ta Capture or Salesforce Inbox. You can access this setting by going to  Setup > Fi-nancial Services Settings > Individual Record Type Mapper.  \u2022  Assign the Individual record type to the user profiles. You need to assign  the Indi-vidual record type to the user profiles that need to create or access  Individual rec-ords. The Individual record type is a standard record type on the  Account object that represents an individual person who is not directly related to  your business, such as a prospect, influencer, or household member. You can  assign record types by going to Setup > Profiles > Object Settings > Accounts >  Record Types.

Flows are a tool  that allows you to automate business processes and guide users or customers  through screens that collect and display information. Flows can have multiple  steps and branching logic that ask for different information depending on the  responses. You can use flows to simplify and streamline complex business  processes, such as ap-plying for a loan, enrolling in a plan, or changing a  beneficiary.

            "explanation": "The following steps are needed to document the requirement for digitizing and  automat-ing the customer onboarding process following the discovery session:  \u2022  Document the business process flows.

You  can use tools such as diagrams, charts, or tables to illustrate the process flows  and identify the pain points, gaps, or opportunities for improvement.  \u2022  Understand the journey for the multiple personas involved in the process.  You need to understand the journey for each persona that participates in or  interacts with the customer onboarding process, such as the customer, the client  specialist, or the manager. You can use tools such as personas, journey maps, or  user stories to capture the needs, goals, pain points, and expectations of each  persona and how they experience the process from their perspective.  \u2022  Determine the best e-signature solution to use. You need to determine the  best e-signature solution to use for collecting and processing digital signatures  from cus-tomers during the onboarding process. You can use tools such as  research, analy-sis, or comparison to evaluate different e-signature solutions  based on criteria such as functionality, compatibility, security, cost, or user  feedback.

In addition, it was decided that  records should be private, but the managerial chain would require visibility into  all their direct reports' records.  Which three security settings must be set up in Salesforce to meet these  requirements?",
            "explanation": "The following security settings must be set up in Salesforce to meet the  requirements of using out-of-the-box Financial Services Cloud objects and  components with minimal cus-tom objects and private record sharing with  managerial visibility:  \u2022  Organization-wide sharing defaults should be set to meet sharing  requirements for all objects in use. Organization-wide sharing defaults are the  baseline level of ac-cess that users have to records that they do not own or are  not explicitly shared with them. You can use organization-wide sharing defaults to  specify the default access level for each object, such as Public Read/Write, Public  Read Only, or Pri-vate. You can also use organization-wide sharing defaults to  enable or disable fea-tures such as grant access using hierarchies, external access,  or external org-wide defaults.  \u2022  The Role Hierarchy in setup should be configured to allow for managers to  auto-matically see records of those under them. The Role Hierarchy is a structure  that represents the levels of data visibility and access that users have in an  organiza-tion based on their role or position. You can use the Role Hierarchy to  define the roles and subordinates for each user and grant access to records  owned by or shared with users below them in the hierarchy. You can also use the  Role Hierarchy to control the visibility of dashboards, reports, and territories.  \u2022  Custom permission sets and out-of-the-box FSC permission sets should be  config-ured or updated and assigned to all users for the use of FSC components  and field-level security. Permission sets are a collection of settings and  permissions that give users access to various tools and functions in Salesforce.  You can use per-mission sets to grant additional permissions or access levels to  users without changing their profile. You can also use permission sets to control  the field-level security for each object and field, which determines whether users  can view, edit, or delete data in those fields. Financial Services Cloud provides  several out-of-the-box permission sets that grant access to FSC components and  features, such as Action Plans, Financial Accounts, or Relationship Groups. You  can also create cus-tom permission sets to meet your specific business needs.  Verified References: : Salesforce Help Article 1 : Salesforce Help Article 2 :  Salesforce Help Article 3",

CDS can help financial services companies comply with  regulations and policies that restrict data visibility based on user roles. Some  considerations regarding CDS are:  \u2022  Participant Roles provide another way to grant data access without  overwriting sharing behavior from existing sharing features. Participant Roles are  custom objects that define the possible roles for users who need access to  Account or Opportunity records. For example, a Participant Role can be Advisor,  Client, Specialist, or Decision Maker. Each Participant Role has an associated  access level that determines what data fields the user can view or edit. For  example, an Advisor can have full access to all fields, while a Client can have read- only access to some fields.  \u2022  Compliance managers and Salesforce administrators can enable CDS for  Account and Opportunity objects. CDS is not enabled by default in Financial  Services Cloud. To enable CDS, compliance managers or administrators need to  create an integration definition record for each object that they want to enable  CDS for. An integration definition record specifies the object name, the field name  that contains sensitive data (such as Notes), the field name that contains the  record owner (such as OwnerId), and the field name that contains the record type  (such as RecordTypeId).  \u2022  Role Hierarchy\u2014based sharing is disabled by default in CDS. Role Hierarchy  is a feature of Salesforce that allows users to inherit access to records from their  managers or peers in the role hierarchy. For example, if a user has access to an  Account record, their manager also has access to that record by default. However,  in CDS, role hierarchy\u2014based sharing is disabled by default for Account and  Opportunity objects.

Referral leads can have fields such as Referrer Name,  Referrer Account, and Referral Type to track the source and nature of the referral.  \u2022  General: This record type can be used to capture leads that are generated  from general marketing campaigns or events. General leads can have fields such  as Campaign Name, Campaign Source, and Lead Score to track the effectiveness  and potential of the marketing efforts.  \u2022  Retirement Planning: This record type can be used to capture leads that are  interested in retirement planning services or products. Retirement planning leads  can have fields such as Retirement Age, Retirement Goal, and Current Savings to  assess the needs and suitability of the leads.",

            "explanation": "Reference: Set Up Clients, Households, and Relationships, Compliant Data Sharing  in Financial Services Cloud | Salesforce Trailhead, Track Client Interactions -  Salesforce  Explanation: Some considerations when adopting FSC-related objects are:  \u2022  In a household, each household member is modeled as a Contact, and the  household is modeled as an Account. A household is a type of relationship group  that represents a group of clients who have a direct relationship with one another  and shared financials, such as spouses and their dependent children. A household  is modeled as an Account record with a custom record type of Household. Each  household member is modeled as a Contact record that is related to the  household Account. A household can also have related accounts and contacts that  are not part of the household, but are associated with it for some reason.  \u2022  Both the Financial Deal object and the Opportunity object support  Compliant Data Sharing. Compliant Data Sharing (CDS) is a feature of FSC that  allows granular control over access to sensitive data in Account and Opportunity  objects. CDS can help financial services companies comply with regulations and  policies that restrict data visibility based on user roles. CDS can also be enabled  for the Financial Deal object, which is a custom object that represents a business  opportunity or transaction with a client. The Financial Deal object can be used  instead of or in addition to the Opportunity object, depending on the business  needs.  \u2022  Interaction Summary is an enhancement of the standard Activity object.  FSC implementations should use Interaction Summary as a replacement for the  Activity object. Interaction Summary is a custom object that captures the details  of a client interaction, such as a meeting, a call, or an email. Interaction Summary  can be linked to other FSC objects, such as Financial Accounts, Financial Goals,  Financial Deals, or Relationship Groups. Interaction Summary can also have  participants, which are records that represent the people or groups involved in  the interaction.",

A person account is a combination of an account and  a contact record that represents an individual customer. To convert an individual  account record to a person account record, the individual account record must  have exactly one contact record related to it.

Reciprocal roles are  custom objects that define the possible roles for users who need access to  Account or Contact records. For example, a reciprocal role can be Advisor, Client,  Specialist, or Decision Maker. Each reciprocal role has an associated access level  that determines what data fields the user can view or edit. To create reciprocal  roles, the administrator needs to do the following steps:  o  From Setup, open Object Manager.  o  In the Quick Find box, enter Reciprocal Role, and then select Reciprocal  Role.  o  Click Fields & Relationships, and then select Role Name.  o  Click New to create a new picklist value for the Role Name field.  o  Enter a label and a value for the new role, such as Attorney or Client.  o  Click Save.  \u2022  The user should be using the Edit Group button to access reciprocal roles.  The Add Contact option on the relationship tree only allows the user to add  existing contacts as members of a relationship group, such as a household or a  business group. The user cannot specify reciprocal roles for the members using  this option. To specify reciprocal roles for the members of a relationship group,  the user needs to do the following steps:  o  Click Edit Group on the relationship group record page.  o  In the Edit Group window, click Member Relationships.  o  For each member of the group, select a role from the Role picklist and a  related role from the Related Role lookup.  o  Click Save.",

            "explanation": ", C, E    Explanation:  Record alerts are a feature of Financial Services Cloud that let users create and  display alerts on record pages to highlight important information or actions.  Record alerts are based on OmniStudio, a low-code platform for building digital  experiences in Salesforce. To access or extend permissions for record alerts in  Financial Services Cloud, users need to have one of the following permission sets:  \u2022  FSC Standard permission set: This permission set grants access to the core  features of Financial Services Cloud, including record alerts. Users with this  permission set can view and create record alerts on supported objects, such as  accounts, contacts, financial accounts, and opportunities1.  \u2022  FSC Foundations permission set: This permission set grants access to the  common features of Financial Services Cloud that are shared across subverticals,  such as retail banking, wealth management, and insurance. Users with this  permission set can view and create record alerts on supported objects2.  \u2022  OmniStudio User permission set: This permission set grants access to the  OmniStudio features, such as OmniScripts, DataRaptors, Integration Procedures,  and Record Alerts. Users with this permission set can view and create record  alerts on any object that has the Record Alert component enabled3.

            "question": "Cumulus Insurance has a franchise business model with a large number of  franchisees who operate independently but report to regional managers who are  Cumulus employees. The company would like the franchise owners and their  employees to have access to the Cumulus Salesforce Financial Services Cloud  (FSC) instance. The company plans to use the Role Hierarchy and sharing rules to  implement this. What should the architect at Cumulus Insurance be aware of for  this solution?",
            "explanation": "Explanation:  The architect at Cumulus Insurance should be aware of the limitation that the  administrator can define up to 300 total sharing rules for each object when using  the Role Hierarchy and sharing rules to implement the franchise business model.  Sharing rules are a way of granting additional access to records based on criteria,  such as record owner, role, or field values. The Role Hierarchy is a way of  organizing users into a hierarchy that reflects the reporting structure of the  company. The Role Hierarchy and sharing rules can be used together to control  the access and visibility of records for different users in Financial Services Cloud.  However, there is a limit of 300 sharing rules per object, which means that the  administrator may need to use other methods, such as public groups or manual  sharing, to grant access to records beyond this limit.
